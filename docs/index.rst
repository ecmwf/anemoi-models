   This documentation is work in progress.

*Anemoi* is a framework for developing machine learning weather
forecasting models. It comprises of components or packages for preparing
training datasets, conducting ML model training and a registry for
datasets and trained models. *Anemoi* provides tools for operational
inference, including interfacing to verification software. As a
framework it seeks to handle many of the complexities that
meteorological organisations will share, allowing them to easily train
models from existing recipes but with their own data.

*Anemoi models* provides the core model components for used by the rest
of the *Anemoi* packages to train graph neural networks for data-driven
weather forecasting.
