 Data Indices

Data routing with a DataIndex system that knows where data is passed
based on config entries.

This documentation aims to first explain the user side (configs), and
then goes into detail for developers.

Good news first: You don't need to know the index of data in your Zarr

*******************
 Usage Information
*******************

The routing information can be changed in the config in data.

There are currently three types of data with respect to the model:

-  Prognostic: Data that is input into and output from the model

-  Forcing: Data that informs the model as auxiliary information but
   isn't output nor fed to the loss

-  Diagnostic: Data that is not input into the model, but is produced in
   the inference. (It's pseudo-diagnostic, as it is fed to the loss
   during training, so the model is still conditioned on this data.)

The default in Anemoi Models is that data is prognostic. But data can be
switched to forcing or diagnostic by adding the value to the existing
config entry:

.. code:: yaml

   data:
     forcing:
       - "lsm"
       - "sdor"
     diagnostic:
       - "tp"
       - "cp"

.. figure:: ../schemas/data_indices.png
   :alt: Schematic of IndexCollection with Data Indexing on Data and Model levels.
   :align: center

Additionally, prognostic and forcing variables can be remapped and
converted to multiple variables. The conversion is then done by the
remapper-preprocessor.

.. code:: yaml

   data:
     remapped:
       d:
         - "d_1"
         - "d_2"

There are two main Index-levels:

-  Data: The data at "Zarr"-level provided by Anemoi-Datasets
-  Model: The "squeezed" tensors with irrelevant parts missing.

Additionally, there are two internal model levels (After preprocessor
and before postprocessor) that are necessary because of the possiblity
to remap variables to multiple variables.

-  Internal Data: Variables from Data-level that are used internally in
   the model, but not exposed to the user.
-  Internal Model: Variables from Model-level that are used internally
   in the model, but not exposed to the user.

All indices at the different levels are split into two versions:

-  Input: The data going into training / model
-  Output: The data produced by training / model

Each of these four indices has four integer Tensors available to slice
into the data:

-  full: The indices of all "relevant" data, i.e. prognostic and forcing
   for the input data.
-  diagnostic: The indices for data that is "output only" and not fed to
   the model.
-  prognostic: The indices for data that is in both the input and output
   for the training and model.
-  forcing: The indices for data that is only input into the model but
   doesn't exist in the forecast state.

The data can be accessed via dot notation in such a way that:

.. code:: python

   data_indices.<model/data>.<input/output>.<full/diagnostic/prognostic/forcing>

Examples:

.. code:: python

   data_indices.data.input.full
   data_indices.model.output.diagnostic

The name_to_index dictionary is available for each of the four indices,
which provides a mapping from variable name to index at that level.
These are useful for providing users an interface in the config that
does not rely on the knowledge of index-locations in the data.
Generally, hard-coded locations are to be avoided.

*******************
 Index Collections
*******************

The Index Collections module provides a collection of indices, which are
used to index and slice the data.

.. automodule:: anemoi.models.data_indices.collection
   :members:
   :no-undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

*******
 Index
*******

The Index module provides all data indices and methods for indexing and
slicing the data.

.. automodule:: anemoi.models.data_indices.index
   :members:
   :no-undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

********
 Tensor
********

This provides the underlying data structure for the indices. It creates
a tensor of the appropriate size and shape, and provides methods for
indexing and slicing the data.

.. automodule:: anemoi.models.data_indices.tensor
   :members:
   :no-undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
